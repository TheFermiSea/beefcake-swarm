message: "Use tracing::info!() instead of println!() for structured logging"
note: |
  The orchestrator uses `tracing` for structured, level-filtered logging.
  `println!()` bypasses log levels and isn't captured in SLURM job logs properly.
  Use `tracing::info!()`, `tracing::debug!()`, or `tracing::warn!()` instead.
